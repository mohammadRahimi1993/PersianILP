# 📚 PersianILP: An Inductive Link Prediction Dataset for Persian Language

**PersianILP** is a custom-designed dataset for modeling and predicting links in semantic graphs of the Persian language. This project aims to advance inductive learning techniques in Persian NLP using deep learning and graph-based methods.

## ⚙️ Installation Requirements

Before running the code, please install the following libraries. Make sure to use the specified versions to ensure full compatibility with PersianILP:

```bash
pip install torch==2.2.0 torchvision==0.17.0 torchaudio==2.2.0
pip install dgl -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/torch-2.2/repo.html
pip install torchmetrics==1.2.1 transformers==4.38.0
pip install safetensors==0.4.1
pip install torcheval
pip install scikit-learn
pip install deep-translator
```

> 💡 Note: DGL must be installed using the provided link to match the PyTorch 2.2 version.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Supports inductive learning models for semantic graph analysis  
- Tailored for Persian language with linguistic-specific considerations  
- Suitable for link prediction, semantic reasoning, and conceptual translation tasks
